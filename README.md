# triangle-tracker

## Goal

#### Practice bringing everything we've learned this week together by creating a project that includes custom functions, branching, forms, jQuery, and well-separated user interface and business logic.
#### By _**{David Butler}**_

## Description
#### Make a web page that allows the user to input the lengths of the sides of a triangle, and returns whether these sides form an equilateral, isosceles, or scalene triangle or if the sides cannot make a triangle at all. Here are the definitions of each possibility:
* Equilateral: All sides are equal.
* Isosceles: Exactly 2 sides are equal.
* Scalene: No sides are equal.
* NOT a triangle: The sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is less than or equal to the length of the third side.
